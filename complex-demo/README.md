# Complex Demo Project
This project uses some of the more advanced features of git. It isn't intended as a working application and **won't** be maintained.

Features of note:
- use of `.gitkeep` to make sure otherwise empty folders are tracked
- use of a `.gitignore` file to make sure some folders and files are ignored
- use of multiple branches to track changes including merges
